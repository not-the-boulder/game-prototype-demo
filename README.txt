This is demo for a prototype of an Avatar style open world game.

The component files of the game are too big for uploading, so 2 were taken out.  
Unzip the project and then copy and paste the 2 pak files in the avatarFirebert2/Content/Paks directory.
There may be issues with anti virus programs.

The data_pack folder has to be in the same directory as the executable.  You can change the images in the data_pack, but they must use the same names to be picked up by the game.
